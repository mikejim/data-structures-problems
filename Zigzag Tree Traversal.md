![Tree](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/02/19/tree1.jpg)

Problem: Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between). Example:

Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]

Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]
