# data-structures-problems
This is a repository where I will upload solutions to problems posted on pages such as Leetcode, AlgoExperts, and so own. 

All the posted solutions will be mine, I will try my best to provide optimal solutions. In the meanwhile, I'll upload my accomplishments. 

Uploads will be mainly in C#, but might combine sometimes Java or Python
